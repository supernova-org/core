A dense city that is a veritable melting pot of cultures and creativity. Nowhere else has such variety and vibrancy in art, food, architecture, philosophy, nature, technology...
<ul><li>Buildings
<ul><li>are designed around beauty.</li>
<li>built to last
<ul><li>their modular structure increases their longevity as they adapt to change and technological progress</li>
<li>all buildings follow the highest standards of quality. With every new standard, all buildings are upgraded</li></ul></li>
<li>incorporate a variety of designs and materials rooted in a variety of cultural influences or purely avant-garde creations but always integrated with nature
<ul><li>This diversity creates a number of different environments within the same city with their own characteristic vibe and style.</li></ul></li>
<li>within this variety, the different urban environments still form a connected ecosystem rather than stand alone units
<ul><li>living, business and commercial space intertwine to ensure vibrancy and minimize the need for commutes</li></ul></li>
<li>The city forms an intricate maze that intertwines with nature. Unlike regular cities, this one increases its density with above ground walkways that maximize usable space
<ul><li>Still, it does not feel crowded nor cramped as it is designed to receive a lot of light and multiple park areas offer breathing room between buildings
<ul><li>Many of these areas are even agricultural ones: more precisely: orchards, which do not benefit from economies of scale when configured in great patches of unbroken fields</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>A web of the most advanced transport solution : magvlev for silent and fast mobility with a small footprint (both environmental and physical), connects all these areas
<ul><li>The freed up ground space allows people to walk across spaces without the need to stop for traffic or follow a rigid path</li></ul></li>
<li>Moments of solitude are also important, and therefore, the outskirts of the city are designed for isolation and also vary a great deal to offer the greatest options of vibes and moods.</li>
<li>Our unique economic system means everyone does not live at the same pace and on the same time-frames. The city is alive no matter the hour, everyone is not on vacation at the same time nor at work at the same time.
<ul><li>This helps with the city, though dense, not being crowded at certain times. It enables a 24/7 economy which will enrich all of us. (More on that in the economy section). </li></ul></li>

Education
</div>
<div class="ss-content">
Education never stops, it covers all skills, sciences, arts, and fosters a culture of acceptance, creativity and freedom. This will drastically decrease hate, economic strife, crime, discrimination of all kinds, boredom from routine and depression, while increasing innovation, skill levels, and social bonds. Knowledge from different fields will cross-fertilize each other and accelerate progress. Having more people knowing more also helps. People will also learn to live better and to express their individual tastes and personalities. The formerly oppressed: LGBTQ+, minority races, women, etc... are not only accepted but thrive. Reaching this scale of enlightenment is referred to as the Bloom.

<div class="ss-content">
The environment
</div>
<div class="ss-content">
We will not only put an end to environmental degradation, we will actively reverse it and help nature conquer back our planet. We will reach unprecedented levels of biodiversity and respect for the environment.<br>
This will be achieved through higher urban density, a natural decrease in the global population thanks to a culture that favors a maximum of 2 children, thanks also to the end of over-consumption and the adoption of the highest standards of environmental friendliness.
</div>
<div class="ss-header">
Labor
</div>
<div class="ss-content">
All labor that does not require an innordinate amount of specialized skill will de divided upon everyone.<br>
<ul>
<li>-This prevents a dependency on unskilled labor;</li>
<li>-Puts an end to the drudgery of routine corporate jobs;</li>
<li>-Fosters a lot more innovation:</li>
<ul>
<li>--Exposing everyone to all tasks increases the likelihood that one will find a new idea</li>
<li>--Being in contact with a variety of areas increases cross-fertilization of skills and disciplines</li>
</ul>
<li>-Brings a variety of life experiences (first-hand knowledge of how everyting works);</li>
<li>-Increases the value given to common goods as everyone is directly involved in its upkeep:</li>
<ul>
<li>--People are less inclined to litter if it means ruining the effort they put into cleaning</li>
<li>--People are less inclined to over-consume if they know the effort it takes to produce things;</li>
</ul>
<li>-Increases social bonds as everyone is involved and put on the same level</li>
<li>-Reduces the cost of common goods for society</li>
<ul>
<li>--Reduced over-consumption</li>
<li>--Innovations</li>
<li>--Increase in productivity thanks to rotation which avoids strain</li>
<li>--No need for decent wages as this is not the work that sustains a person full-time</li>
</ul>

Strength in Unity
</div>
<div class="ss-content">
The greatest barrier to change is the feeling of loneliness that drives you to think you can't make a difference.<br>
Supernova unites likeminded enlightened people that together, <strong>will</strong> take over.<br>
You will build a community that works together within the system to bring on change from the shifting of mentalities all the way to complete dominance over narrow-minded bigotted ideals and the founding of a new civilization. <span class="prompt">Join here</span>
